Okay, let's continue with the **Chalchitra Cookbook: The Definitive Guide to Motion Canvas**.

## Part 3: Mastering Animation – Movement, Timing, and Control ρυθμός

With an understanding of scenes and components, it's time to delve into how you bring them to life. This part focuses on the principles of animation within Motion Canvas: how things move, how to control their speed and character, and how to orchestrate complex sequences.

---

### 3.1 Tweening: The Art of Smooth Transitions

**Goal:** Understand how Motion Canvas creates smooth animations (tweens) between a property's starting and ending states, and how to chain these transitions.

**Core Concepts Involved:** `yield*`, property accessors (e.g., `nodeRef().property()`), target values, duration, chained tweens (`.to()`, `.back()`), interpolation.

**What is Tweening?**

"Tweening" (short for in-betweening) is the process of generating intermediate frames between a starting and an ending keyframe to create the illusion of smooth motion or change. When you tell Motion Canvas to change a circle's position from X=0 to X=300 over 1 second, it automatically calculates all the in-between positions for each frame.

**Basic Tween Syntax:**

You initiate a tween using `yield*` followed by accessing the property you want to animate on your referenced node, and then calling it like a function with the target value and duration.

```typescript
import { makeScene2D, Circle } from "@motion-canvas/2d";
import { createRef } from "@motion-canvas/core";

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const myCircle = createRef<Circle>();

  view.add(<Circle ref={myCircle} x={-300} size={100} fill={"#24C1E0"} />);

  // Animate the 'x' property of myCircle to 300 over 2 seconds
  yield* myCircle().position.x(300, 2);

  // Animate the 'fill' color to 'red' over 1 second
  yield* myCircle().fill("red", 1);

  // Animate the 'scale' (uniform) to 1.5x over 0.5 seconds
  yield* myCircle().scale(1.5, 0.5);
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `myCircle()`: Accesses the node instance through its reference.
- `.position.x(targetValue, duration)`:
  - `.position.x`: Specifies the property to animate (the x-component of position). Other examples: `.opacity`, `.scale`, `.fill`, `rectRef().width`, `lineRef().points`.
  - `targetValue`: The value the property should reach at the end of the animation.
  - `duration`: How long the animation should take, in seconds.

**Tweening Different Property Types:**

Motion Canvas can tween various types of properties:

- **Numbers:** `x`, `y`, `opacity`, `scale`, `rotation`, `width`, `height`, `fontSize`, `lineWidth`, etc.
- **Colors:** `fill`, `stroke`. Colors are interpolated through their color space.
  ```typescript
  yield * myCircle().fill("#FF0000", 1); // To red
  yield * myCircle().fill("rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5)", 1); // To semi-transparent blue
  ```
- **Vector2 (and other vector types):** `position`, `scale` (when providing `[xScale, yScale]`), `size` (for `Rect` when providing `[width, height]`).
  ```typescript
  import { Vector2 } from "@motion-canvas/core";
  // ...
  yield * myCircle().position(new Vector2(100, 50), 1);
  yield * myCircle().scale([2, 0.5], 1); // Scale X by 2, Y by 0.5
  ```
- **Arrays of Numbers/Vectors (e.g., `Line.points`, `Path.data` indirectly):** Motion Canvas attempts to interpolate between arrays. For paths, this enables shape morphing if the structures are compatible.
  ```typescript
  // For a Line node with ref 'myLine'
  // yield* myLine().points([[0,0], [100,100], [0,100]], 1);
  ```
- **Strings (e.g., `Txt.text`):** It will attempt to diff the strings and animate the changes (letters appearing/disappearing/changing).
  ```typescript
  // yield* myText().text("New Value", 1);
  ```

**Chained Tweens (`.to()` and `.back()`):**

For a single property, you can create a sequence of tweens that flow smoothly from one to the next using `.to()`.

```typescript
import { makeScene2D, Rect } from "@motion-canvas/2d";
import { createRef } from "@motion-canvas/core";

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const myRect = createRef<Rect>();

  view.add(
    <Rect ref={myRect} y={-200} width={100} height={100} fill={"lightgreen"} />
  );

  // Animate y to 0, then to 200, then back to 0
  yield* myRect()
    .position.y(0, 1) // To y=0 over 1s
    .to(200, 1) // Then to y=200 over 1s
    .to(0, 1); // Then back to y=0 over 1s

  // Using .back() to reverse the previous .to() segment
  yield* myRect()
    .scale(2, 0.75) // Scale to 2x
    .to(0.5, 0.75) // Then scale to 0.5x
    .back(0.75); // Then back to 2x (reverses the ".to(0.5, 0.75)" part)
});
```

- `.to(targetValue, duration, timingFunction?)`: Appends another segment to the tween for the _same property_.
- `.back(duration?, timingFunction?)`: Reverses the most recently added segment of the chain. If duration is omitted, it uses the original segment's duration.

**Underlying Interpolation:**

Motion Canvas uses interpolation functions to calculate the intermediate values. While you often don't interact with these directly for simple tweens, the `tween()` function (covered later) allows more explicit control over this. The default interpolation is usually linear for values and then shaped by a timing function (easing).

---

### 3.2 Timing Functions (Easings): Adding Character to Movement

**Goal:** Learn how to control the rate of change in an animation, making movements feel more natural or stylized (e.g., slow start, fast middle, slow end).

**Core Concepts Involved:** Timing functions (easings), `linear` motion, common easing types.

**What are Timing Functions?**

By default, animations might proceed linearly (constant speed). Timing functions, also known as easing functions, modify this rate of change, controlling the acceleration and deceleration of the tween. This adds personality and realism to animations.

**How to Apply Timing Functions:**

Most tweening methods in Motion Canvas accept an optional third argument (after `targetValue` and `duration`) for the timing function.

```typescript
import { makeScene2D, Circle } from "@motion-canvas/2d";
import {
  createRef,
  linear,
  easeInOutCubic,
  easeOutBounce,
} from "@motion-canvas/core"; // Import timing functions

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const circle1 = createRef<Circle>();
  const circle2 = createRef<Circle>();
  const circle3 = createRef<Circle>();

  view.add(
    <>
      <Circle ref={circle1} x={-400} y={-100} size={80} fill={"#FFC857"} />
      <Circle ref={circle2} x={-400} y={0} size={80} fill={"#E9724C"} />
      <Circle ref={circle3} x={-400} y={100} size={80} fill={"#C5283D"} />
    </>
  );

  // Circle 1: Linear motion (constant speed)
  yield* circle1().position.x(400, 2, linear);

  // Circle 2: Smooth ease-in and ease-out
  yield* circle2().position.x(400, 2, easeInOutCubic);

  // Circle 3: Bounces at the end
  yield* circle3().position.x(400, 2, easeOutBounce);
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `import {linear, easeInOutCubic, easeOutBounce} from '@motion-canvas/core';`: You import the specific timing functions you want to use.
- `circle1().position.x(400, 2, linear)`: The `linear` function results in constant speed. This is often the default if no timing function is specified, but being explicit can be clearer.
- `easeInOutCubic`: Starts slow, speeds up in the middle, ends slow. A very common and natural-looking ease.
- `easeOutBounce`: Creates a bouncing effect as the animation concludes.

**Commonly Available Timing Functions:**

Motion Canvas provides a rich set of timing functions, typically categorized by their curve shape (Quad, Cubic, Quart, Quint, Sine, Expo, Circ, Elastic, Back, Bounce). Each category usually has `easeIn`, `easeOut`, and `easeInOut` variations.

- **Linear:**
  - `linear`
- **Quadratic (Quad):** `easeInQuad`, `easeOutQuad`, `easeInOutQuad`
- **Cubic:** `easeInCubic`, `easeOutCubic`, `easeInOutCubic`
- **Quartic (Quart):** `easeInQuart`, `easeOutQuart`, `easeInOutQuart`
- **Quintic (Quint):** `easeInQuint`, `easeOutQuint`, `easeInOutQuint`
- **Sinusoidal (Sine):** `easeInSine`, `easeOutSine`, `easeInOutSine`
- **Exponential (Expo):** `easeInExpo`, `easeOutExpo`, `easeInOutExpo`
- **Circular (Circ):** `easeInCirc`, `easeOutCirc`, `easeInOutCirc`
- **Elastic:** `easeInElastic`, `easeOutElastic`, `easeInOutElastic` (springy, overshoots and settles)
- **Back:** `easeInBack`, `easeOutBack`, `easeInOutBack` (overahoots slightly then settles, like pulling back before moving forward)
- **Bounce:** `easeInBounce`, `easeOutBounce`, `easeInOutBounce` (bounces at the end)

(You'll find these in `@motion-canvas/core` or specifically `import * as ease from '@motion-canvas/core/lib/tweening/timingFunctions';` and then use `ease.easeInOutCubic` etc. The exact import path might vary slightly based on package structure or if they are re-exported from the main `core` entry point.)

**Custom Timing Functions:**

You can also define your own timing function. A timing function is a function that takes a progress value `t` (from 0 to 1) and returns an adjusted progress value (usually also 0 to 1).

```typescript
function myCustomEase(t: number): number {
  return t * t * t; // This is equivalent to easeInCubic
}

// ...
yield * myCircle().position.x(400, 2, myCustomEase);
```

**Chained Tweens with Timing Functions:**

Each segment in a chained tween (`.to()`) can have its own timing function.

```typescript
yield * myRect().position.y(100, 1, easeInQuad).to(0, 1, easeOutQuad);
```

---

This covers the fundamentals of tweening and adding character with timing functions. These are essential for making your animations feel alive and engaging.

---

Okay, let's continue with **Part 3: Mastering Animation – Movement, Timing, and Control** in the Chalchitra Cookbook.

---

### 3.3 Flow Control: Orchestrating Your Animations

**Goal:** Learn how to manage the sequence, timing, parallelism, and repetition of your animation tasks to create complex and precisely controlled narratives.

**Core Concepts Involved:** `ThreadGenerator` (the type of animation tasks, like what `makeScene2D`'s function returns or what `yield* node.prop()` produces), and various flow control functions.

Motion Canvas executes animations sequentially by default due to the nature of generator functions (`yield*` completes before the next line is run). Flow control functions allow you to deviate from this simple sequence to build more intricate animations.

---

#### 1. `waitFor(seconds: number)`: Pausing the Animation

**Goal:** Introduce a delay or pause in your animation sequence.

**Signature (Simplified):** `waitFor(durationInSeconds: number)`

**Basic Usage:**

```typescript
import { makeScene2D, Circle } from "@motion-canvas/2d";
import { createRef, waitFor } from "@motion-canvas/core";

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const myCircle = createRef<Circle>();
  view.add(<Circle ref={myCircle} size={100} fill="lightblue" x={-200} />);

  yield* myCircle().position.x(0, 1); // Animate to center

  yield* waitFor(0.5); // Pause for half a second

  yield* myCircle().position.x(200, 1); // Animate to the right
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `import {waitFor} from '@motion-canvas/core';`: Imports the `waitFor` function.
- `yield* waitFor(0.5);`: The animation will pause at this point for 0.5 seconds before executing any subsequent `yield*` commands.

**Key Behaviors/Notes:**

- `waitFor` is itself an animation task, so it must be used with `yield*`.

---

#### 2. `all(...tasks: ThreadGenerator[])`: Parallel Execution

**Goal:** Run multiple animation tasks simultaneously.

**Signature (Simplified):** `all(task1: ThreadGenerator, task2: ThreadGenerator, ...)`

**Basic Usage:**

```typescript
import { makeScene2D, Rect, Circle } from "@motion-canvas/2d";
import { createRef, all, waitFor } from "@motion-canvas/core";

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const myRect = createRef<Rect>();
  const myCircle = createRef<Circle>();

  view.add(
    <>
      <Rect ref={myRect} width={100} height={100} fill="lightcoral" x={-150} />
      <Circle ref={myCircle} size={100} fill="skyblue" x={150} />
    </>
  );

  yield* waitFor(0.2);

  // Run these animations at the same time
  yield* all(
    myRect().position.y(-100, 1.5), // Rect moves up
    myRect().rotation(360, 1.5), // Rect also rotates
    myCircle().position.y(100, 1) // Circle moves down (shorter duration)
  );

  // This line will only execute after ALL animations in the 'all' block complete.
  // Since the Rect animations take 1.5s and Circle takes 1s, 'all' will take 1.5s.
  yield* waitFor(0.5);
  // ... more animations
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `import {all} from '@motion-canvas/core';`: Imports the `all` function.
- `yield* all(taskA, taskB, ...);`: All specified tasks (taskA, taskB, etc.) will start at the same time.
- The `all` block is considered complete only when the **longest task** within it has finished.

**Key Behaviors/Notes:**

- Essential for creating effects where multiple things happen in concert (e.g., a character jumps while an object falls).
- Each argument to `all` must be a `ThreadGenerator` (i.e., an animation task, typically something you'd `yield*`).

---

#### 3. `sequence(delay: number, ...tasks: ThreadGenerator[])`: Sequential Execution with Delays

**Goal:** Run animation tasks one after another, with a specified delay inserted _between_ each task.

**Signature (Simplified):** `sequence(interTaskDelay: number, task1: ThreadGenerator, task2: ThreadGenerator, ...)`

**Basic Usage:**

```typescript
import { makeScene2D, Circle } from "@motion-canvas/2d";
import { createRef, sequence, waitFor } from "@motion-canvas/core";

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const circle1 = createRef<Circle>();
  const circle2 = createRef<Circle>();
  const circle3 = createRef<Circle>();

  view.add(
    <>
      <Circle ref={circle1} size={80} fill="red" y={-100} opacity={0} />
      <Circle ref={circle2} size={80} fill="green" y={0} opacity={0} />
      <Circle ref={circle3} size={80} fill="blue" y={100} opacity={0} />
    </>
  );

  // Tasks will run one by one, with a 0.3s pause between the end of one
  // and the start of the next.
  yield* sequence(
    0.3, // Delay between tasks
    circle1().opacity(1, 0.5), // Task 1: Fade in circle1
    circle2().opacity(1, 0.5), // Task 2: Fade in circle2
    circle3().opacity(1, 0.5) // Task 3: Fade in circle3
  );
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `import {sequence} from '@motion-canvas/core';`: Imports the `sequence` function.
- `yield* sequence(delay, taskA, taskB, ...);`:
  - `taskA` runs.
  - Then, there's a `delay` (in seconds).
  - Then, `taskB` runs.
  - Then, another `delay`.
  - And so on.
- The `delay` is _between_ tasks, not before the first one or after the last one within the sequence block itself.

**Key Behaviors/Notes:**

- If you want a sequence with no delay between tasks, you can pass `0` for the delay, or consider using `chain`.
- The total duration of the `sequence` block will be the sum of all task durations plus the sum of all inter-task delays.

---

#### 4. `chain(...tasks: ThreadGenerator[])`: Chaining Tasks Sequentially

**Goal:** Run animation tasks one after another, primarily used for composing animation segments without an inherent inter-task delay (unlike `sequence`).

**Signature (Simplified):** `chain(task1: ThreadGenerator, task2: ThreadGenerator, ...)`

**Basic Usage:**

```typescript
import { makeScene2D, Rect } from "@motion-canvas/2d";
import { createRef, chain } from "@motion-canvas/core";

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const myRect = createRef<Rect>();
  view.add(<Rect ref={myRect} size={100} fill="orange" />);

  const part1 = myRect().position.x(200, 1);
  const part2 = myRect().fill("purple", 0.5);
  const part3 = myRect().rotation(90, 1);

  // Execute part1, then part2, then part3 sequentially.
  yield* chain(part1, part2, part3);
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `import {chain} from '@motion-canvas/core';`: Imports the `chain` function.
- `yield* chain(taskA, taskB, ...);`: This function simply `yields*` each provided task one by one. `taskA` completes, then `taskB` starts immediately, then `taskC`, and so on.
- It's often used when you've defined parts of an animation as separate `ThreadGenerator` variables and want to play them back in order.

**Key Behaviors/Notes:**

- Similar to just writing multiple `yield*` statements directly, but `chain` can be useful for programmatically constructing sequences or passing around a "macro" animation.
- If you need delays between chained tasks, you'd insert `waitFor()` tasks within the `chain` arguments: `chain(taskA, waitFor(0.5), taskB)`.

---

#### 5. `loop(times: number | (() => boolean), factory: (index: number) => ThreadGenerator)`: Repeating Animations

**Goal:** Execute one or more animation tasks repeatedly.

**Signature (Simplified):**
`loop(count: number, taskFactory: (iteration: number) => ThreadGenerator)`
`loop(condition: () => boolean, taskFactory: (iteration: number) => ThreadGenerator)`
`loop(taskFactory: (iteration: number) => ThreadGenerator)` (loops indefinitely)

**Basic Usage:**

1.  **Looping a Fixed Number of Times:**

    ```typescript
    import { makeScene2D, Circle } from "@motion-canvas/2d";
    import { createRef, loop, waitFor, chain } from "@motion-canvas/core";

    export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
      const myCircle = createRef<Circle>();
      view.add(<Circle ref={myCircle} size={80} fill="teal" x={-100} />);

      // Loop 3 times
      yield* loop(
        3,
        (
          index // 'index' will be 0, 1, 2
        ) =>
          chain(
            // Use chain for sequence within each loop iteration
            myCircle().position.x(100, 0.5),
            waitFor(0.1),
            myCircle().position.x(-100, 0.5),
            waitFor(0.1)
          )
      );
    });
    ```

2.  **Looping Indefinitely (or until a condition changes):**

    ```typescript
    // ... (setup as above) ...
    let shouldContinueLooping = true; // An external condition

    // This loop will run as long as shouldContinueLooping is true
    // Or use loop(() => true, ...) or just loop(factory) for infinite
    yield *
      loop(
        () => shouldContinueLooping, // Condition function
        (index) =>
          chain(myCircle().opacity(0.2, 0.75), myCircle().opacity(1, 0.75))
      );

    // To stop it from outside (e.g., after another event or time):
    // yield* waitFor(5);
    // shouldContinueLooping = false;
    ```

    If you provide only the factory, `loop(factory)`, it loops indefinitely.

**Explanation:**

- `import {loop} from '@motion-canvas/core';`: Imports the `loop` function.
- `loop(countOrCondition, taskFactory)`:
  - `countOrCondition`:
    - If a `number`, the loop runs that many times.
    - If a `function` that returns a `boolean`, the loop continues as long as the function returns `true`. The condition is checked _before_ each iteration.
  - `taskFactory`: A function that takes the current iteration `index` (0-based) as an argument and **must return a `ThreadGenerator`** (the animation task to be executed for that iteration).

**Key Behaviors/Notes:**

- The `taskFactory` allows you to vary the animation in each iteration using the `index`.
- For an infinite loop, you can use `loop(Infinity, factory)` or just `loop(factory)`. Be careful with infinite loops; ensure your scene has a defined end or a way to break out if needed, or that it's a background effect.

---

#### 6. `spawn(task: ThreadGenerator)`: Background ("Fire and Forget") Tasks

**Goal:** Start an animation task that runs in the background independently of the main animation sequence. The main sequence does not wait for the spawned task to complete.

**Signature (Simplified):** `spawn(taskToRunInBackground: ThreadGenerator)`

**Basic Usage:**

```typescript
import { makeScene2D, Circle, Rect } from "@motion-canvas/2d";
import { createRef, spawn, loop, waitFor, chain } from "@motion-canvas/core";

export default makeScene2D(function* (view) {
  const mainActor = createRef<Rect>();
  const backgroundEffect = createRef<Circle>();

  view.add(
    <>
      <Rect ref={mainActor} size={100} fill="blueviolet" />
      <Circle ref={backgroundEffect} size={50} fill="goldenrod" opacity={0} />
    </>
  );

  // Spawn a background looping animation for the circle
  // The main animation flow will NOT wait for this loop to finish.
  spawn(
    loop(
      (
        index // Infinite loop
      ) =>
        chain(
          backgroundEffect().opacity(0.7, 1),
          backgroundEffect().scale(1.5, 1),
          waitFor(0.2),
          backgroundEffect().opacity(0, 1),
          backgroundEffect().scale(1, 1),
          waitFor(0.2)
        )
    )
  );

  // Main animation continues immediately
  yield* mainActor().position.x(200, 2);
  yield* waitFor(1);
  yield* mainActor().rotation(360, 2);
  // The backgroundEffect will continue pulsing while mainActor animates.
});
```

**Explanation:**

- `import {spawn} from '@motion-canvas/core';`: Imports the `spawn` function.
- `spawn(task);`: Starts `task` running. The code immediately continues to the next line after `spawn`, it doesn't `yield*` or wait.
- Motion Canvas manages these "spawned" tasks as separate threads of execution within the scene.

**Key Behaviors/Notes:**

- Useful for continuous background effects, particles, or any animation that should run independently of the primary narrative flow.
- Spawned tasks are still tied to the lifecycle of the scene. When the scene ends, its spawned tasks are typically terminated.
- `spawn` returns a `Task` object, which can sometimes be used to control the spawned animation (e.g., `task.cancel()`), though this is a more advanced use case.

---

#### 7. `waitUntil(eventOrTimeOrPromise: string | number | Promise<void>)`: Conditional Pausing

**Goal:** Pause the animation until a specific named event occurs, a certain amount of time on the global timeline passes, or a JavaScript Promise resolves.

**Signature (Simplified):**
`waitUntil(eventName: string)`
`waitUntil(timeInSeconds: number)`
`waitUntil(promise: Promise<void>)`

**Basic Usage:**

1.  **Wait Until an Event (Often used with Slides):**
    Motion Canvas has a concept of "slides" (like presentation slides). You can transition between them and wait for slide changes.

    ```typescript
    // ...
    // yield* myFirstSlideAnimations();
    // yield* view.slideTransition(slideTransitionEffect); // Transition to next slide
    // yield* waitUntil('Next Slide'); // Assumes 'Next Slide' is an event triggered

    // In a multi-slide presentation structure, `slideTransition` might implicitly
    // trigger events that `waitUntil` can listen for, or you might define slides
    // with names and transition to them.
    // A common pattern:
    // yield* beginSlide('My Introduction Slide');
    // ... animations for this slide ...
    // yield* waitFor(1); // Wait at the end of the slide content
    //
    // To proceed to the next "logical" slide in editor or presentation mode, you'd click next.
    // Programmatically, to sequence named slides:
    // yield* presentSlide('slide1', {duration: 1, transition: MyTransition});
    // yield* presentSlide('slide2', {duration: 1, transition: MyTransition});
    // The `waitUntil` for events is more for complex event-driven logic.
    ```

    The `waitUntil` is powerful for synchronization. For basic slide progression, `yield* slideTransition()` or just structuring your code sequentially often handles it. `waitUntil` becomes key when reacting to custom events or specific player states.

2.  **Wait Until a Specific Time on the Scene's Timeline:**

    ```typescript
    // Assume current time is 2.0 seconds into the scene
    yield * waitUntil(5.0); // This will pause for 3.0 seconds until scene time reaches 5.0s
    ```

    This is less common than `waitFor` for relative delays but can be useful for syncing to an absolute point in the scene's timeline.

3.  **Wait Until a Promise Resolves:**

    ```typescript
    async function myAsyncOperation(): Promise<string> {
      return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve("Data fetched!");
        }, 2000); // Simulate a 2-second network request
      });
    }

    // ... in makeScene2D ...
    // Start the async operation (don't await it here if you want animation to continue)
    const dataPromise = myAsyncOperation();
    // console.log('Started fetching data...');

    yield * myCircle().position.x(100, 1); // Do some animation

    // Now wait for the promise to complete
    yield * waitUntil(dataPromise);
    // const result = await dataPromise; // If you need the result
    // console.log('Async operation completed!', result);

    yield * myCircle().fill("green", 0.5); // Animate after data is fetched
    ```

**Explanation:**

- `import {waitUntil} from '@motion-canvas/core';`: Imports `waitUntil`.
- `yield* waitUntil(...)`: Pauses execution based on the argument.
  - **Event Name (string):** The scene will listen for an event with this name. This is tied into Motion Canvas's event system, often used with `ナビゲーション.next()` (player navigation) which triggers events like `next`, or custom events emitted via `player.dispatch`.
  - **Time (number):** Pauses until the scene's internal clock reaches this absolute time in seconds.
  - **Promise:** Pauses until the provided `Promise` resolves.

**Key Behaviors/Notes:**

- `waitUntil` is crucial for synchronizing with external actions, asynchronous operations, or specific points in a more complex, event-driven presentation structure.
- For named events, something else in your code or the Motion Canvas player needs to _dispatch_ that event.
